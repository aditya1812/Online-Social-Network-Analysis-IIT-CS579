In this project I am analysing the brand 'Gucci' for its male and female users. The demographic inference 
is used for the same. Also the communities from the users are detected and analysed. From the overall analysis
it can be seen that more women are talking about the brand than the men. Also there are eight communities
formed. 

collect. py is used to collect data from twitter. It uses Twitter API to collect the tweets. To collect the tweets 
search/tweets is used. First it collects 100 tweets and then the max ID is used to collect next 100 tweets and so on.
In total 5000 tweets are collected.
In the next half of this file we collect the friends of the set of users that we get from the tweets. This data is stored in 
the pickle for use.

In classify.py the US census data is used to get the male and female names in the US. Then using these names 
each tweet has been assigned gender. Then the accuracy of our analysis is measured.
Also the number of male and female are determined those we get from matching our tweets with the census data.
Also the tweets are tokenized and we get the dictionary for the tokens in each tweet.

In cluster.py the friends list of the users are taken that we have collected from the collect.py. Then the Girvan Newman 
method is used to detect the communities from the users. Also the graph has been drawn that shows the 
different communities.

In summerization.py the results of the entire work are produced. It gives the number of tweets collected, 
Number of users collected, Number of communities detected, average number of users per communities.
The histogram shows the number of male and female twitter users those we have identified.
